Data frame in Janka.xlsx files contain two meaningful attributes. Please write the R program that reads file janka.csv and then computes: 
1.  mean, variance and standard deviation for every attribute 
2.  covariance between attributes (i.e. covariance matrix), 
3.  histograms for each attribute assuming samples are drawn from probability distribution 
4.  Experimental CDF for each attribute and plot it 
5.  percentiles for each attribute with a step 0.1  
6.  quantile-to-quintile plot between attributes
